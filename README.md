# Notes from Martin post project:
* This is a part of a group project I worked in, we were 6 in total.
* I have removed most parts of the project that are not related to my contribution. Thus this repository is not runnable, you would need hardware anyway. Nevertheless, the ML code is quite adhoc to run the few models we opted for in the end.
* My main contribution is ML research and implementation, as well as researching and implementing pre-processing techniques for time-series data. By research I mean study existing published research.
* In report_and_slides/ there are a bunch of documents which I have contributed to as specified in the next sub-section:

## Document contributions
* Presentation slides: Almost every slide
* After Study: Chapter 3
* System Design Specification: 4.1.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.7. 
* Technical documentation: 4.3, 5.1(except 5.1.1), 5.2, 5.3, chapter 7.
